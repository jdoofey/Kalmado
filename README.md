# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Get Started

### Clone repository.

- SSH:

```
git@github.com:jdoofey/Kalmado.git
```

- HTTPS:

```
https://github.com/jdoofey/Kalmado
```

- CLI:
```
gh repo clone jdoofey/Kalmado
```

### Install dependencies & Prep database.
- In the project directory you will run:

```
pipenv install
```

This command will install packages into the pipenv virtual environment and update your Pipfile.

- Create a .env file in said current directory.
- Paste in SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL configurations.

```
SECRET_KEY=<<SECRET_KEY>>
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///dev.db
```

The .env file contains the individual user environment variables that override the variables set in the /etc/environment file. You can customize your environment variables as desired by modifying your .env file. In this case we are setting the SECRET_KEY and the DATABASE_URL.

- While in your root directory run:

```
pipenv shell
```

This will create a new active pip environment for  you to run your backend.

- Followed by:

```
flask db upgrade
flask seed all
pipenv run flask run
```

Because this application uses SQLite, the upgrade command will detect that a database does not exist and will create it.

- Navigate to your /Kalmado/react-app/ folder and create another .env file.
- Paste in the REACT_APP_BASE_URL

```
REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
We'll be pasting in the path to server for frontend into this newly created environment file.

- All there is to do is:

```
npm install
```
This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on. Since the package has a package-lock the installation of dependencies will be driven by that. If you take a peak into your package.json file you can see all the dependencies our project is installing.

```
npm start
```
This runs a predefined command specified in the "start" property of a package's "scripts" object in our case it is:

```
"start": "react-scripts start"
```
DO NOT paste this anywhere. The code above is already provided in our package.json file!

*et voil√†! You're good to go!*
